# Configuring the 03-sessions playbooks

The sessions module runs the standard web sessions model - it takes the `page_views_staged` table - produced by the Page Views module - as an input.

`01-sessions-main.yml.tmpl` runs the main web model logic. `99-sessions-complete.yml.tmpl` truncates the input table, and runs cleanup steps afterwards. `XX-destroy-sessions.yml.tmpl` destroys all tables and manifests, for a complete rebuild.

## Configuration quick reference

`01-sessions-main`

`:scratch_schema:`     name of scratch schema  
`:output_schema:`      name of derived schema
`:entropy:`            string to append to all tables, to test without affecting prod tables (eg. `_test` produces tables like `sessions_test`). Must match entropy value used for all other modules in a given run.
`:stage_next:`         update staging tables - set to true if running the next module. If true, make sure that the next module includes a 'complete' step.
`:upsert_lookback:`    Default 30. Period of time (in days) to look back over the production table in order to find rows to delete when upserting data. Where performance is not a concern, should be set to as long a value as possible.
`:skip_derived:`       Default false. Set to true to skip insert to production sessions table.

**Note:** upsert_lookback can produce duplicates if set to too short a window.

`99-sessions-complete`

`:scratch_schema:`     name of scratch schema
`:output_schema:`      name of derived schema
`:entropy:`            string to append to all tables, to test without affecting prod tables. Must match entropy value used for all other modules in a given run.
`:cleanup_mode:`       Options: `debug` - only keeps main tables. `trace` - keeps all tables. `all` - cleans up everything.
`:ends_run:`           set to true if there are no subsequent modules in the run, false otherwise.

`XX-destroy-sessions`

`:scratch_schema:`     name of scratch schema
`:output_schema:`      name of derived schema
`:entropy:`            string to append to all tables, to test without affecting prod tables. Must match entropy value used for all other modules in a given run.
`:cleanup_mode:`       Should be set to `all` for a destroy.
`:ends_run:`           Should be set to true for a destroy.

## Order of execution

Custom steps should run before `99-sessions-complete.yml.tmpl`, but after `01-sessions-main.yml.tmpl`, as follows:

1: 01-sessions-main.yml.tmpl
2: AA-my-custom-sessions-level-module.yml.tmpl
3: 99-sessions-complete.yml.tmpl

Custom modules should produce tables which join to the sessions table rather than altering it where possible.
