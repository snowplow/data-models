# Snowplow Data Models

## Blah

## Prerequisites

These models are written in a format that is runnable via [SQL-runner](https://github.com/snowplow/sql-runner) - available for download from [Bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/).

They each also require a dataset of Snowplow events, generated by one of [the tracking SDKs](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/), passed through the validation and enrichment steps of the pipeline, and loaded to a database.
